        Plates.

        Plates are a structured storage type, grids of wells that each function like containers. Plates come in two
        types: a traditional "fixed" type, where the wells cannot move, and a "matrix" type. A matrix plate has similar
        functionality to a box, where the containers inside can be moved around and removed altogether.

        Plates are all associated with schemas, which define the type of the plate (e.g. "96 Well Plate") along with
        the fields that are tracked, the dimensions of the plate, and whether or not the plate is a matrix plate or a
        traditional well plate.

        Like all storage, every Plate has a barcode that is unique across the registry.
